# Keystroke overlay

The keystroke overlay turns the shortcuts you press during a tutorial
recording into editable on-screen keycap clips on a dedicated **Keystrokes**
overlay track. Each clip is an ordinary title clip — once generated you can
move, retime, restyle, or delete any of them.

Recording is **opt-in**. Nothing is recorded until you tick the consent box and
press **Start recording** — or, if you used the **Record** panel to capture a
tutorial, you can pull shortcuts from that capture session's sidecar instead
(see _Loading shortcuts from a capture session_ below).

## What is captured

Only **non-text shortcuts** are written to the log. The recording gate
explicitly rejects:

- Events from `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, `[contenteditable]`, or any
  field with `type="password"`.
- Single printable characters held without `Ctrl`, `Alt`, or `Meta`. **Shift
  alone does not unlock recording** — `Shift+a` (capitalised text) stays
  private.

Modifier combinations (`Ctrl+S`, `Alt+Tab`, `Cmd+Shift+Z`), navigation keys
(`Escape`, arrows, `PageUp`), and function keys (`F5`, `F12`) are recorded.

Each combo is stored as a canonical string with modifiers sorted alphabetically
(`Alt+Ctrl+Shift+...`) and the space key normalised to `Space`.

## Using it

1. Open **Keystroke Overlay** from the toolbar.
2. Tick **I understand and want to record shortcuts**.
3. Click **Start recording**. The panel listens to keydown events globally
   while focus is anywhere outside form fields.
4. Use your tool as you normally would for the tutorial. Recorded combos
   appear in the live log with relative timestamps.
5. Click **Stop recording** when finished.
6. Press **Insert overlay clips** to add the clips to the timeline.

## What you get on the timeline

- Clips land on a **Keystrokes** track at the top of the track list. If no
  Keystrokes track exists, one is created.
- Combos within 300 ms are merged into a single clip with combos joined by
  `·` (e.g. `Ctrl+C · Ctrl+V`). The merge is also capped at **4 combos** or
  **1 second** of span so a rapid run of shortcuts never collapses into one
  giant clip.
- Each clip's default duration is **1.2 seconds**, truncated if the next clip
  begins sooner.
- The keycap style is monospace on a dark pill, ready for screencasts. Edit
  any clip's text or style in the Inspector after insertion.

## Loading shortcuts from a capture session

When you record a tutorial via the **Record** panel, the capture session
automatically logs the same kinds of shortcut events into a sidecar file
(`events.ndjson`) alongside the recorded media — the same `Ctrl+S` /
`Alt+Tab` / function-key filter applies, and printable typing and password
fields are still excluded.

After the recording finishes ("landed"), open the Keystroke Overlay panel
and press **Load events from last recording**. The panel populates from the
sidecar instead of running its own listener, so you don't have to re-enact
the tutorial just to capture the keystroke overlay.

While a capture session is **actively recording**, manual recording in this
panel is disabled — the capture session is already logging shortcuts, and
running two listeners would double-record everything. The panel shows a note
explaining why.

## What's captured during a recording

The capture session's DOM tap applies the same `shouldRecordKey` gate as the
manual mode in this panel:

- **Captured**: modifier combos (`Ctrl+S`, `Alt+Tab`, `Cmd+Shift+Z`),
  navigation keys (`Escape`, arrows, `PageUp`), function keys (`F5`, `F12`),
  pointer-down/-up coordinates with held modifiers.
- **Not captured**: any keystroke in an `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`,
  `[contenteditable]`, or `type="password"` field; bare printable characters
  (including `Shift+letter` capitalised text); events in cross-origin iframes
  the editor cannot read.

The sidecar lives in browser-local storage (OPFS) alongside the recorded
media — it never leaves your machine and is removed together with the
session if you discard or import the recording.

## Limitations

- Recording only watches the active tab. It cannot read keystrokes in another
  window or in the operating system itself.
- Shortcuts pressed before you click **Start recording** (manual mode) are
  not recoverable; the log only collects events between Start and Stop.
  Sidecar mode covers the whole capture session, but it still cannot recover
  events from before the session started.
- The overlay is purely cosmetic — it does not control playback timing or fire
  any action.
