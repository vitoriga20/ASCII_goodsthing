# Design: Phase 36 — Voice Cleanup

> Status: **Implemented** — PR 72 phase implementation with verified WASM provenance and browser smoke coverage.

## Goal

Give everyday creators three audio-quality tools that work in every browser
without WebNN, without a cloud service, and without an explicit "process clip"
workflow: (a) an RNNoise-class WASM denoiser that runs live on the monitor
AudioWorklet and in the offline export render chain; (b) EBU R128
integrated-loudness analysis and a one-click normalisation pass; (c) a noise
gate and brickwall limiter on the Phase 16 master bus. Settings persist through
the project document and travel in bundles.

## Non-goals

- **ML speech enhancement beyond RNNoise-class** — no deep-learning
  enhancement, spectral masking models, or similar ML inference beyond
  RNNoise's GRU-based suppressor.
- **Stem/source separation or de-reverb** — the denoiser targets broadband
  stationary noise, not room acoustics or musical instrument isolation.
- **Modification of Phase 28 (WebNN RNNoise)** — Phase 28 stays the
  optional/experimental per-clip path producing undoable cleaned-audio assets.
  Phase 36 is the always-available everyday path on the monitor and export
  buses. The two features are complementary; they share the RNNoise algorithm
  but use independent code paths.
- **Per-frame loudness automation** — normalisation is a single integrated-pass
  makeup gain, not dynamic range compression or limiter metering beyond the
  insert described in R3.
- **Phase 46 re-implementation** — the gate and limiter DSP functions live in
  `src/engine/live-audio/gate.ts` and `src/engine/live-audio/limiter.ts`
  (Phase 46, PR #63). Phase 36 reuses them without modification.

## Positioning: Phase 28 vs Phase 36

This distinction must be communicated clearly in the UI and docs:

| | Phase 28 (WebNN RNNoise) | Phase 36 (WASM RNNoise) |
|---|---|---|
| Requires WebNN | Yes | No |
| Runs in | Dedicated cleanup worker | AudioWorklet (live) + pipeline worker (export) |
| Produces | Undoable cleaned-audio asset per clip | Real-time monitor + export bus processing |
| User workflow | Load model → Preview → Apply | Enable toggle per track |
| Processing scope | Selected clip | All enabled tracks simultaneously |

## WASM provenance

PR #57 established the local precedent for checked-in WASM artifacts generated
by a narrow, reproducible script (`npm run build:wasm`) rather than a general C
toolchain in the repo. That exact WAT/wabt approach does not transfer to
RNNoise: the denoiser is several thousand lines of C plus trained weights.

Phase 36 chooses the closest matching route: `scripts/build-rnnoise-wasm.mjs`
vendors the pinned, org-backed `@jitsi/rnnoise-wasm@0.2.1` artifact, verifies
the npm tarball SHA-256, extracts `dist/rnnoise.wasm`, and generates:

- `src/engine/voice-cleanup/rnnoise.wasm` — checked into the repo (112,141
  bytes), same artifact pattern as `src/engine/resampler-simd.wasm`.
- `src/engine/voice-cleanup/rnnoise-wasm-b64.ts` — base-64 encoded, imported
  only as a source-tree provenance artifact, same pattern as
  `src/engine/resampler-simd-wasm-b64.ts`.
- `src/engine/voice-cleanup/rnnoise-wasm-manifest.json` — declares the
  npm package/version, package tarball hash, source repository, license, exact
  byte size, and `sha256-<hex>` checksum; validated at load time.
- `public/rnnoise/rnnoise.wasm` and `public/rnnoise/manifest.json` — runtime
  copies loaded as bytes and passed into the AudioWorklet port. This avoids
  source-module fetch/import behavior and keeps the worklet independent of
  Emscripten JS glue.

Emscripten is only an upstream build detail of the vendored package. The repo
does not require an Emscripten install for development or CI. A future switch to
a pinned wasi-sdk/zig build or Rust port is allowed, but it must keep the same
checked-in artifact and checksum contract and justify replacing the current
Jitsi-provenance route.

## EBU R128 / ITU-R BS.1770-4 algorithm

### K-weighting filter (48 kHz coefficients)

K-weighting applies two biquad filters in series to each channel before
mean-square computation:

**Stage 1 — Pre-filter (high-shelf):**
```
H1(z): b0 = 1.53512485958697, b1 = −2.69169618940638, b2 = 1.19839281085285
       a0 = 1.0,              a1 = −1.69065929318241, a2 = 0.73248077421585
```

**Stage 2 — RLB high-pass:**
```
H2(z): b0 = 1.0,  b1 = −2.0, b2 = 1.0
       a0 = 1.0,  a1 = −1.99004745483398, a2 = 0.99007225036616
```

These are the published BS.1770-4 coefficients for 48 kHz, reproduced here for
reference. The implementation in `src/engine/voice-cleanup/kweighting.ts`
hard-codes these values as `const`; no run-time computation of poles/zeros.

### Gated loudness algorithm

The analysis processes audio as a **continuous non-overlapping stream** to
preserve biquad filter state integrity. K-weighting is applied once to each
sample; the 400 ms measurement windows are formed by buffering the already-
filtered samples in a sliding window (ring buffer).

1. Stream the master mix in non-overlapping 100 ms blocks via
   `mixAudioWindow(startS, 0.1)` (the same function used by the export path),
   advancing the read position by 100 ms per step.
2. Apply K-weighting to each channel of each 100 ms block independently,
   carrying biquad state continuously across blocks (never reset).
3. Append the K-weighted samples to a per-channel ring buffer of 400 ms
   capacity. After every 100 ms block is appended, compute the mean square
   of each channel over the full 400 ms ring contents (the "sliding window").
4. Form the multichannel loudness of window `i`:
   `l_i = −0.691 + 10 * log10(Σ_c G_c * mean_square_c_i)`
   where `G_c` is the channel weight (1.0 for L/R/C, 1.41 for Ls/Rs; for
   stereo: 1.0 for both).
5. **Absolute gate:** discard windows where `l_i < −70` LUFS.
6. **Relative gate:** compute ungated loudness `L_KG` from surviving windows;
   discard windows where `l_i < (L_KG − 10)` LU.
7. **Integrated loudness:** recompute mean from doubly-gated windows.

This approach ensures:
- Biquad state flows forward monotonically (no backward time jumps).
- Each audio sample is rendered and K-weighted exactly once (no 4× overhead).
- At most a 400 ms ring buffer per channel is in memory at any time.

```

Key architectural boundaries:

- **Main thread stays interactive.** The loudness analysis runs in the pipeline
  worker. The WASM denoiser DSP runs in the AudioWorklet (monitor path) and
  the pipeline worker (export path). No DSP on main.
- **No CPU pixel round-trips.** The voice-cleanup chain is audio-only and does
  not touch the GPU video pipeline.
- **Phase 46 DSP functions are reused as-is.** `processGate` and
  `processLimiter` from `src/engine/live-audio/gate.ts` and
  `src/engine/live-audio/limiter.ts` are called directly by Phase 36 code.
  State dependency on PR #63: if the file paths drift, the dependency is on
  the exported pure function signatures, not the file names.

## Worklet latency budget

At 48 kHz / 128-sample quantum, with all inserts active:

| Stage | Samples | ms (48 kHz) |
|---|---|---|
| AudioWorklet quantum | 128 | 2.67 |
| Denoiser ring (collect 480) | 480 | 10.00 |
| Limiter lookahead (Phase 46) | 240 | 5.00 |
| Gate | 0 | 0.00 |
| **Total (active)** | **848** | **≈ 17.67** |

This budget is for the monitor path. When all inserts are bypassed the total
is 0 ms (pass-through). The table is displayed in the Voice Cleanup panel and
also reported in the diagnostics snapshot. Values scale inversely with
`AudioContext.sampleRate` (the denoiser resamples to/from 48 kHz as needed;
see R1.2).

## Components

### `src/engine/voice-cleanup/rnnoise-wasm-manifest.json`

```json
{
  "provenance": "@jitsi/rnnoise-wasm@0.2.1",
  "npmPackage": "@jitsi/rnnoise-wasm",
  "npmVersion": "0.2.1",
  "npmTarballSha256": "<sha256>",
  "sourceRepository": "https://github.com/jitsi/rnnoise-wasm",
  "license": "Apache-2.0 wrapper, BSD-3-Clause RNNoise core",
  "emscriptenVersion": "upstream-prebuilt",
  "rnnoiseCommit": "upstream-package",
  "simd": false,
  "sizeBytes": 0,
  "checksum": "sha256-<hex>"
}
```

`sizeBytes` and `checksum` are filled in by `scripts/build-rnnoise-wasm.mjs`
after vendoring.

### `src/engine/voice-cleanup/rnnoise-wasm-b64.ts`

Auto-generated by the build script. Exports `RNNOISE_WASM_B64: string`.
Kept as a checked-in source artifact for provenance parity with PR #57; the
browser runtime loads the public `.wasm` bytes and verifies them against the
public manifest before worker/worklet use.

### `src/engine/voice-cleanup/rnnoise-processor.ts`

```typescript
/** Loads and wraps the RNNoise WASM module for use in the worker and worklet. */

interface RnnoiseInstance {
  /** Process one 480-sample mono frame. Returns VAD probability (unused). */
  processFrame(input: Float32Array, output: Float32Array): number;
  destroy(): void;
}

/** Load the WASM module from the public asset copy, verify checksum. */
export async function loadRnnoise(): Promise<{ createInstance(): RnnoiseInstance }>;

/**
 * Frame-adaptation ring with fixed-size I/O: push(N) always returns exactly
 * N denoised samples. It buffers input until 480 samples are available,
 * processes all complete RNNoise frames in the call, and reads from a
 * pre-primed output ring to compensate for one-frame denoiser latency.
 */
export class RnnoiseRing {
  constructor(instance: RnnoiseInstance);
  /** Push a mono block of any size; returns exactly input.length samples. */
  push(input: Float32Array): Float32Array;
  /** Drain remaining buffered samples (call at end of stream). */
  drain(): Float32Array;
}
```

The WASM memory layout follows the RNNoise C API:
`rnnoise_create() → DenoiseState*`;
`rnnoise_process_frame(state, out, in)` operates on 480 `float` samples
in the WASM heap. `RnnoiseRing` manages the 480-sample input accumulator and a
pre-primed output ring. `push(block)` loops internally: it appends input to the
accumulator, processes all complete 480-sample frames until fewer than 480
samples remain, and returns exactly `block.length` samples from the output
ring. This prevents accumulator growth when input blocks exceed 480 samples
(e.g. the 1024-sample blocks used in the offline export render chain) while
keeping AudioWorklet and export block sizes stable.

### `src/engine/voice-cleanup/kweighting.ts`

```typescript
/** BS.1770-4 K-weighting biquad chain for one channel. */
export interface KWeightState {
  x1: number; x2: number; y1: number; y2: number; // stage 1
  x1b: number; x2b: number; y1b: number; y2b: number; // stage 2
}
export function createKWeightState(): KWeightState;
/** Apply K-weighting to a mono block. Mutates state (carries across blocks). */
export function kWeightBlock(input: Float32Array, state: KWeightState): Float32Array;
```

### `src/engine/voice-cleanup/ebu-r128.ts`

```typescript
/** Stateful EBU R128 integrated loudness analyser. */
export class LoudnessAnalyser {
  private readonly sampleRate: number;
  constructor(sampleRate: number);

  /** Feed one 400 ms stereo (or mono) window. Advances window index.
   *  Returns nothing; call integratedLoudness() after all windows. */
  feedWindow(leftOrMono: Float32Array, right?: Float32Array): void;

  /** Compute gated integrated loudness (LUFS) from all fed windows. */
  integratedLoudness(): number;

  reset(): void;
}

/** Compute makeup gain in dB to reach targetLufs from measuredLufs. */
export function normalisationGain(measuredLufs: number, targetLufs: number): number;
```

### `src/engine/voice-cleanup/voice-cleanup-processor.ts`

Pipeline-worker-side denoiser and master-bus processor for export. The per-track
denoiser runs **before** track summation (on each track's individual PCM); the
master-bus inserts (gate, normalisation gain, limiter) run **after** summation.

```typescript
export interface VoiceCleanupChainState {
  denoiserRings: Map<string, RnnoiseRing>; // keyed by trackId
  gateState: GateState;                    // Phase 46 GateState
  limiterState: LimiterState;              // Phase 46 LimiterState
}

export function createVoiceCleanupChainState(): VoiceCleanupChainState;

/**
 * Denoise a single track's mono PCM in place. Called per-track BEFORE
 * track summation in mixAudioWindow. Uses the per-track RnnoiseRing.
 * No-op if the track is not in denoiserEnabledTracks.
 */
export function denoiseTrackPcm(
  trackId: string,
  monoPcm: Float32Array,
  state: VoiceCleanupChainState,
): void;

/**
 * Apply master-bus inserts to the summed stereo interleaved buffer:
 * gate → normalisation gain → limiter.
 * Called AFTER all tracks have been summed. Mutates `pcm` in place.
 */
export function applyMasterCleanupChain(
  pcm: Float32Array,
  channels: number,
  params: MasterCleanupChainParams,
  state: VoiceCleanupChainState,
  sampleRate: number,
): void;

export interface MasterCleanupChainParams {
  normaliseGainDb: number;
  limiterCeilingDbtp: number;
  gateParams: GateParams;          // Phase 46 type
  limiterParams: LimiterParams;    // Phase 46 type
}
```

The denoiser MUST NOT run on the summed master downmix — RNNoise treats
non-speech audio (music, SFX) as noise and would aggressively suppress it.
Per-track denoising preserves non-speech elements on tracks that are not
denoiser-enabled.

### `src/engine/voice-cleanup/loudness-analysis.ts`

```typescript
/** Runs the full EBU R128 analysis pass on the current project mix.
 *  Calls mixAudioWindow for successive 400 ms windows.
 *  Reports progress via onProgress callback.
 *  Returns measured integrated loudness and computed normalisation gain. */
export async function analyseLoudness(
  options: LoudnessAnalysisOptions,
  onProgress: (fraction: number) => void,
  signal: AbortSignal,
): Promise<{ measuredLufs: number; normalisationGainDb: number }>;
```

### `src/protocol.ts` (extended)

New commands and state messages following existing kebab-case, domain-verb naming:

```typescript
// Commands (WorkerCommand additions)
| { type: 'voice-cleanup-analyse-loudness'; targetLufs: number }
| { type: 'voice-cleanup-cancel-analysis' }
| { type: 'voice-cleanup-apply-normalisation'; normalisationGainDb: number }
| { type: 'voice-cleanup-update-settings'; settings: VoiceCleanupSettings }

// State messages (WorkerStateMessage additions)
| { type: 'voice-cleanup-analysis-progress'; fraction: number; currentWindowS: number }
| { type: 'voice-cleanup-analysis-result'; measuredLufs: number; normalisationGainDb: number }
| { type: 'voice-cleanup-analysis-cancelled' }
| { type: 'voice-cleanup-analysis-error'; message: string }
```

`VoiceCleanupSettings` (matches the `ProjectDoc` field):

```typescript
interface VoiceCleanupSettings {
  denoiserEnabledTracks: string[];
  normalisationTargetLufs: number;
  normaliseGainDb: number;
  limiterCeilingDbtp: number;
  gateParams: GateParams;      // Phase 46 type (bypass + threshold/range/attack/hold/release)
  limiterParams: LimiterParams; // Phase 46 type (bypass + ceiling/attack/release)
}
```

### `src/engine/project.ts` (extended)

```typescript
// Added to ProjectDoc:
voiceCleanup?: VoiceCleanupSettings;
```

Schema version bumped to the next unused version after v11 (claimed by
Phase 46 PR #63). Write "bump `PROJECT_SCHEMA_VERSION` to the next unused
version" in the implementation task; do not hardcode a number.

The `parseProjectDoc` / `migrateProjectDoc` functions in
`src/engine/project.ts` add a validation pass for `voiceCleanup` using the
existing `isRecord` / `finiteNumber` / `requiredString` helpers. A missing or
invalid `voiceCleanup` field falls back to `DEFAULT_VOICE_CLEANUP_SETTINGS`
(an exported const with the defaults from R5.2).

### `src/ui/VoiceCleanupPanel.tsx`

Four-section panel (see R6.2). Communicates with the worker via the protocol
messages above. Reads gate/limiter SAB meter slots from the Phase 46 extended
SAB layout for live input/output peak display (reuses the existing meter-read
path in `src/ui/audio-engine.ts`). No media objects or WebGPU handles.
`onCleanup` for every listener.

## SAB layout for denoiser bypass (Phase 46 extension)

The Phase 46 SAB layout uses `SAB[34]` for the insert-level denoiser bypass
flag and reserves `SAB[35..47]` for Phase 36 parameters. Phase 36 uses
`SAB[35]` and `SAB[36]` for the per-track denoiser bypass bitmask and
`SAB[37]` for the normalisation gain in dB. To avoid IEEE 754 NaN
canonicalization risks when storing
raw 32-bit integers in `Float32Array` slots, each SAB word stores a
**16-bit float-safe integer** (max value 65,535):

- `SAB[35]`: bypass bitmask for tracks 0–15 (standard float, read via
  `Math.round(sab[35])`, then bitwise extract).
- `SAB[36]`: bypass bitmask for tracks 16–31 (same encoding).

This supports up to 32 tracks without precision loss or NaN corruption.
The AudioWorklet reads `Math.round(sab[35])` and `Math.round(sab[36])` and
extracts the bit at position `trackIndex % 16` (word 0) or
`(trackIndex - 16) % 16` (word 1) to determine bypass state per track.
This does not add or remove SAB slots — it uses the pre-reserved space.

## Persistence and schema

`voiceCleanup` is a field in `ProjectDoc` parsed during load. Missing field →
use `DEFAULT_VOICE_CLEANUP_SETTINGS`. Extra unknown sub-fields are tolerated
(forward compatibility). No bundle format changes: `project.json` already
carries the whole `ProjectDoc`.

Schema bump wording: bump `PROJECT_SCHEMA_VERSION` to the next unused version
after v11. Migration function: if `schemaVersion < new_version`, default
`voiceCleanup` to `DEFAULT_VOICE_CLEANUP_SETTINGS`.

## Dependencies

- **Phase 16 (merged):** `applyMasterAndClamp` and `applyMixStage` from
  `src/engine/audio-mix.ts`; master bus and AudioWorklet in
  `src/ui/audio-engine.ts`.
- **Phase 46 (open PR #63):** pure-DSP functions `processGate` /
  `processLimiter` from `src/engine/live-audio/gate.ts` /
  `src/engine/live-audio/limiter.ts`; SAB slot reservations at indices 17–22
  (gate), 30–33 (limiter), 34–35 (denoiser bypass). The contract this spec
  relies on: exported pure functions `processGate(input, state, params,
  sampleRate)` and `processLimiter(input, state, params, sampleRate)` and the
  SAB slot layout. If PR #63's file paths change before merge, Phase 36 adapts
  to wherever those functions land; the SAB slot indices are fixed by the
  Phase 46 published layout and must not move.
- **Phase 23 (merged):** bundles travel `ProjectDoc` automatically; no extra
  work needed.
- **Phase 9 (merged):** `voiceCleanup` mutations (normalisation apply/reset)
  go through the worker-owned snapshot undo/redo stack.
- **Phase 6/17 (merged):** `mixAudioWindow` in `src/engine/export.ts` is the
  analysis pass's source of audio; the export render chain inserts the
  voice-cleanup processor after `applyMixStage`.

## Third-party additions

- **No new runtime npm dependencies.** The RNNoise WASM artifact is vendored
  from pinned `@jitsi/rnnoise-wasm` package contents and checked in, following
  the existing `build:wasm` artifact pattern. The package manager is only used
  by the reproducibility script; the app runtime imports the checked-in bytes.

## Validation

| Scenario | Expected |
|---|---|
| App startup — denoiser off | WASM not loaded; no fetch; startup bundle unchanged |
| Enable denoiser on a track | WASM loads (once), checksum verified; monitor audio denoised; export denoised |
| Analyse loudness — −23 LUFS sine | Measured LUFS within ±0.5 LU of −23; gain correction equals target − measured within ±0.01 dB; each sample K-weighted exactly once (no 4× overhead) |
| Apply normalisation → undo | `normaliseGainDb` set then cleared by undo; export gain correction reverted |
| Bypass denoiser A/B toggle | 10 ms crossfade; no click; bypass reflected in SAB bitmask |
| Gate: signal below threshold | Gain reduction applied; insert input/output meters show reduction |
| Limiter: peak above ceiling | Peak clamped to ceiling; 5 ms lookahead delay heard on monitor |
| WASM checksum mismatch | Hard user-visible error in panel; denoiser disabled; pipeline unaffected |
| Browser without WebNN | Phase 36 still works; Phase 28 WebNN cleaned-asset workflow remains unavailable/experimental |
| Phase 28 WebNN cleanup active | Both paths coexist; Phase 36 acts on the already-cleaned audio from Phase 28 |
| `npm run build` + `npm test` | Both green; test count grows |
