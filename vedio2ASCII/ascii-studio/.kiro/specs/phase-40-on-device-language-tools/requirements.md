# Requirements: Phase 40 — On-Device Language Tools

> **Progressive enhancement only.** Strictly additive language features layered on Chrome's
> built-in AI APIs — **Translator** + **LanguageDetector** to translate Phase 22/29 caption
> tracks into a second, timing-identical caption track (bilingual zh/en sidecar export), and
> **Summarizer** + **Prompt** (`LanguageModel`) to draft titles, hashtags, and 文案 from a
> track's transcript into a copyable panel. Everything runs on-device. When the APIs are
> unavailable (Firefox, Safari, Chromium derivatives, or hardware below Chrome's floors) the
> **entire surface is hidden** — no errors, no nags. There is **no cloud fallback** and there
> never will be (see design). No new runtime dependency, no account, no telemetry, no upload.

## R0 — Hard Constraints

- **R0.1** No cloud LLM/translation/summarisation calls, no API key, no account, no telemetry, and no upload of captions, transcript text, or media anywhere. All inference runs on the user's device through Chrome's built-in AI.
- **R0.2** No model is fetched, created, or instantiated at app startup. Boot must be byte-identical in network and storage behaviour whether or not this feature exists. The capability probe performs feature-detection + capability/availability checks only — never `create()`, never a download.
- **R0.3** A model download (Translator / LanguageDetector / Summarizer / `LanguageModel`) is triggered **only** by an explicit user action carrying transient user activation.
- **R0.4** Zero new npm **runtime** dependency. Phase 40 uses browser-native APIs; the only added source is hand-authored, same-origin ambient TypeScript typings (no third-party CDN, no bundled weights).
- **R0.5** **Entirely hidden when unavailable.** When the probe reports no usable API, nothing renders: no side-rail tab, no toolbar button, no panel, no bilingual-export affordance, and no diagnostic nag. Zero console errors and zero visible Language Tools UI.
- **R0.6** **No other feature may depend on Phase 40.** Import, edit, caption editing, transcript, and export must behave identically with the entire Phase 40 surface removed from the build.
- **R0.7** **Draft output is never auto-applied.** Titles/hashtags/文案 land in a read-only, copyable panel; nothing writes to the project document.
- **R0.8** **Translated tracks preserve source timing exactly.** Each output segment copies the source segment's `start` and `duration` verbatim; only `text` changes. Segment count and order are preserved 1:1.
- **R0.9** No cloud fallback now or in any future revision. `design.md` states this plainly.
- **R0.10** The main thread stays interactive. Batch loops `await` per item and yield to the event loop; no sustained synchronous work. (These APIs offload inference to the browser process — there is no JS decode/GPU/encode/pixel loop on main.)
- **R0.11** Bounded memory. Operate on caption/transcript **text** only; never buffer media. Long transcripts are chunked to the model's input quota; streaming is used where the API supports it.

## R1 — Capability Probe (`LanguageToolsProbeResult`)

- **R1.1** Add a `LanguageToolsProbeResult` reporting, per API, a lifecycle state mapped from each global's static `availability()` (`Translator.availability({sourceLanguage, targetLanguage})`, `LanguageDetector.availability()`, `Summarizer.availability()`, `LanguageModel.availability()`): `'available' | 'downloadable' | 'downloading' | 'unavailable'`, plus `'unknown'` when the API is not feature-detected (e.g. SSR/Node test). Covers: `translator` (keyed by language pair), `languageDetector`, `summarizer`, `languageModel`.
- **R1.2** The probe is cheap and side-effect-free: synchronous feature detection (`'Translator' in self`, `'LanguageDetector' in self`, `'Summarizer' in self`, `'LanguageModel' in self`) followed by `await <Global>.availability(...)`. It never calls `create()`, never downloads, never opens a session.
- **R1.3** The probe **does not** feed `deriveCapabilityTierV2` or any pipeline path — display/feature-gate only, matching the Phase 28 (`cleanup`) and Phase 29 (`asr`) feature-probe precedent.
- **R1.4** Translator availability is checked for the concrete pairs the feature uses (`en→zh`, `zh→en`), and results are keyed by pair so direction selection is accurate.
- **R1.5** The probe is re-runnable without side effects so a state can move `downloadable → downloading → available` across a session (e.g. another tab finished the download).

## R2 — Surface Visibility & Gating

- **R2.1** The Language Tools entry point (a side-rail tab / toolbar button) renders **only** when the surface is visible, i.e. at least one relevant API is `'available' | 'downloadable' | 'downloading'`.
- **R2.2** Inside the panel, each capability is gated independently: the **Translate** section appears only when a usable Translator pair (plus LanguageDetector for auto-direction) exists; the **Draft** section shows only the sub-tools whose API (Summarizer / `LanguageModel`) is usable.
- **R2.3** When the whole surface is hidden there is **no** "unavailable" fallback text (stricter than the PublishPanel pattern, which renders an explanatory fallback).
- **R2.4** If APIs appear or disappear mid-session, the surface appears/disappears on the next probe without throwing.

## R3 — Translation → Second Caption Track

- **R3.1** Translate a selected source caption/transcript track (Phase 22/29) to a target language, producing a **new** `CaptionTrack` marked `generatedBy: 'language-tools-phase-40'`.
- **R3.2** Direction defaults from LanguageDetector run over a sample of the source track within {zh, en}; the user can override the target language.
- **R3.3** **Per-segment** translation: each segment's text is translated independently; `start`/`duration` are copied exactly; segment count and order are preserved (R0.8).
- **R3.4** Download lifecycle UX: when the Translator is `'downloadable' | 'downloading'`, the user action creates it with a `monitor` and the UI shows explicit progress (percentage + stated approximate size) before/while downloading, then proceeds to translate.
- **R3.5** The job is cancellable via `AbortSignal`; cancel stops promptly and creates **no** track (no half-written project state).
- **R3.6** Bilingual export: the source + translated tracks export through the existing Phase 22 sidecar path with language-suffixed filenames (e.g. `name.zh.srt` / `name.en.srt`). A single combined dual-language WebVTT is an optional nicety, not required.
- **R3.7** The new track is undoable (Phase 9 snapshots) and persists like any caption track (Phase 9/23).
- **R3.8** Empty or whitespace-only translation results create no track and surface a clear message (reuse the ASR empty-result guard precedent).

## R4 — Draft Panel (titles / hashtags / 文案)

- **R4.1** The draft source is the concatenated, ordered, trimmed segment text of a chosen caption/transcript track.
- **R4.2** Long transcripts are chunked to the model's input quota (using the session's `measureInputUsage()` against its `inputQuota`) and condensed hierarchically (Summarizer over chunks, then over the summaries) before any prompt, keeping inputs bounded (R0.11). When only the Prompt API is available, the prompt input is still bounded to `inputQuota` before sending.
- **R4.3** Summarizer produces a short description/summary (`type` configurable — default `key-points` or `tldr`; `format: 'plain-text'`).
- **R4.4** `LanguageModel` (Prompt API) produces N title options, a hashtag set, and a 文案 (social caption) in zh and/or en. Output is parsed defensively (robust to plain text even if structured output is requested).
- **R4.5** Output streams into the panel where supported (`summarizeStreaming` / `promptStreaming`) and is cancellable.
- **R4.6** Output is **read-only and copyable** (per-field copy buttons via `navigator.clipboard`, following the DiagnosticsPanel precedent) and is rendered as plain text via JSX/text nodes — never `innerHTML`. It is never written to the project document (R0.7).
- **R4.7** Each draft sub-tool is independently feature-gated; sub-tools whose API is unavailable simply do not render.
- **R4.8** The Prompt API may be unavailable on the public web without an Origin-Trial token or a user flag. The titles/hashtags/文案 tools must hide gracefully in that case; the Summarizer-based description may still be offered if Summarizer is available.

## R5 — Download / Availability UX

- **R5.1** Map availability state to UI: `available` → ready (act immediately, offline); `downloadable` → a one-time "Download model" affordance stating the approximate size; `downloading` → live progress; `unavailable` → hidden (R0.5).
- **R5.2** State the approximate download size **before** any fetch: translation language packs are on the order of tens of MB (Chrome-managed); Summarizer/Prompt share Gemini Nano — multiple GB, downloaded once by Chrome and reused across all sites.
- **R5.3** Live progress comes from the `downloadprogress` event fired on the `monitor` callback passed to `create()`; `e.loaded` is already a fraction in `[0,1]` (there is no `e.total`, by design).
- **R5.4** After a model is `available`, all calls work offline. Phase 40 neither fetches nor caches weights itself — Chrome owns the model lifecycle (so the OPFS/digest model-cache rules used by app-owned ORT assets do not apply here; see design).

## R6 — Threading & Architecture Compliance

- **R6.1** Phase 40 runs on the **main thread**: the browser offloads inference to its own process, the Prompt API is document-context-only on the web, and downloads require user activation. No AI code enters the pipeline worker, and there is no coupling to the WebGPU device or video frames.
- **R6.2** Batch loops `await` per item and yield; long jobs report progress and remain cancellable; the UI never blocks (R0.10).
- **R6.3** The only worker interaction is the authoritative caption-track creation command — the timeline stays worker-authoritative (Phase 22).

## R7 — Diagnostics

- **R7.1** When the surface is visible, an optional display-only diagnostics section may show per-API lifecycle states and last-job info. It is display-only; no logic elsewhere branches on it. When the whole surface is hidden, no diagnostics row is shown (honour R0.5).
- **R7.2** Errors are recorded in the recent-errors store under a `language-tools` subsystem and folded by code.

## R8 — Tests

- **R8.1** Unit-test the probe with mocked globals: each API present/absent and each availability state → correct `LanguageToolsProbeResult` and `surfaceVisible`.
- **R8.2** Unit-test that startup performs zero `create()` calls and zero downloads (spies on the AI globals; module-graph assertion that the controller isn't imported at boot).
- **R8.3** Unit-test the per-segment timing invariant: with a mocked Translator, output segments copy `start`/`duration` exactly and preserve count/order (R0.8).
- **R8.4** Unit-test direction selection from a mocked LanguageDetector, including user override.
- **R8.5** Unit-test transcript assembly + chunk-to-quota (mocked `measureInputUsage`/`inputQuota`) + hierarchical summarisation (mocked Summarizer).
- **R8.6** Unit-test draft assembly from a mocked `LanguageModel` (streaming), and the copy helper.
- **R8.7** Unit-test cancellation (`AbortSignal`) mid-translate and mid-draft: prompt stop, no track, sessions reusable.
- **R8.8** Unit-test the empty-result guard (no track created).
- **R8.9** Unit-test the worker command handler: creates the translated track with copied timing and the `generatedBy` marker; visible in timeline state.
- **R8.10** Browser/Playwright test in standard CI Chromium (where these APIs are absent): the surface is entirely hidden, **zero console errors**, and core import/edit/export are unaffected.
- **R8.11** Quality gate: `pnpm run check` (format:check + lint + typecheck + Vitest + build) green; test count does not decrease.

## R9 — Acceptance Criteria

- **A1** On unsupported browsers: zero console errors and zero visible Language Tools UI; the rest of the app behaves normally.
- **A2** No model download at startup; downloads happen only on explicit user action and always surface progress.
- **A3** The translated track preserves source timing exactly (verbatim `start`/`duration`, 1:1 segments).
- **A4** Draft output is never auto-applied — it is copyable only.
- **A5** Once Chrome reports the models `available`, the features work fully offline.
- **A6** No cloud fallback exists; all inference is on-device.
- **A7** No other feature depends on Phase 40; removing the surface leaves the app fully functional.
- **A8** Bilingual zh/en sidecar export works from the source + translated tracks.
