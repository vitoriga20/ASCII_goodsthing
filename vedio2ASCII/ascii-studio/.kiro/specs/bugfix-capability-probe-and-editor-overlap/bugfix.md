# Bugfix — Capability-probe false negatives + editor chrome overlap & IA

> Status: **Implemented.** **Part 1 (B1–B9, capability + layout) merged in #130/#131**, including the off-main-thread main-frames capture fallback. **Part 2 (B10–B16, editor-chrome information architecture) is implemented**: four job-based right-rail destinations, an honest Media/Beats library switcher, menu/toolbar deduplication, disambiguated audio labels, and compact unavailable-state disclosures. The design-system foundation follow-up is specified separately in [`feature-design-system-foundation`](../feature-design-system-foundation/tasks.md).
>
> This single spec covers the full editor-chrome workstream: the capability-probe false negatives and the workspace-layout/media-bin overlaps (Part 1, merged in #130), plus the navigation/information-architecture reorganization the audit surfaced (Part 2, this branch). They share surfaces and one recurring anti-pattern — primary navigation hidden behind `overflow-x` scrollbars (media bin B9, right-rail tabs B10).

## Summary

A user running Chrome 149 on macOS (WebGPU on, `navigator.ml`/WebNN flag enabled, `crossOriginIsolated === true`, tier reported as **Core WebGPU**) hit a cluster of features that say they are unavailable even though the platform supports them. Direct probing on that profile (see **Environment / evidence** below) shows that several capability probes in [`capability-probe-v2.ts`](../../../src/engine/capability-probe-v2.ts) produce **false negatives** because they request H.264 at a codec **level** too low for the probe resolution, or probe a Worker-only API from the main thread. These false negatives silently drop **H.264/MP4 export** and block **Recording** and **Program Mode**.

Separately, the Ark editor-kit UI (PR #125) appended a **second copy** of the workspace layout rules to [`global.css`](../../../src/global.css); because the duplicate is later in source order with equal specificity, it overrides both the original rules and the `@media` collapse, causing the left dock and right side-rail to overlap the preview on narrower viewports. The publish diagnostics also read as hard failures for an optional capability, and the Live Audio Chain carried an unimplemented "Noise Suppression" placeholder even though cleanup tools live elsewhere.

This spec bundles eight bugs (B1–B8) found from one capable Chrome profile. B1–B4 are the high-impact "feature falsely unavailable" defects; B5 is a too-strict gate with a missing fallback; B6 is the layout regression; B7–B8 are message/clarity fixes.

## Environment / evidence

Probed live against `https://browser-editor.shenghaoc.workers.dev/` (commit `ff3b12c`), Chrome 149, macOS, `crossOriginIsolated === true`, `navigator.gpu` present, `navigator.ml` present.

`VideoEncoder.isConfigSupported` (H.264) — the level digit is the last codec byte (`1E`=L3.0, `1F`=L3.1, `20`=L3.2, `28`=L4.0, `29`=L4.1):

| Config | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `avc1.42E01E` (L3.0) encode @ 1280×720 — **the value `probeCodecs` uses** | **`false`** |
| `avc1.42E01F` (L3.1) encode @ 1280×720 | `true` |
| `avc1.42E020` (L3.2) encode @ 1280×720 | `true` |
| `avc1.42001E` (L3.0) realtime+HW @ 1920×1080 — **the value `probeVideoEncodeRealtime` uses** | **`false`** |
| `avc1.42E028` (L4.0) realtime+HW @ 1920×1080 | `true` |
| `avc1.42E029` (L4.1) realtime+HW @ 1920×1080 | `true` |
| `avc1.42E01E` (L3.0) **decode** @ 1280×720 | `true` (decoders ignore the level → tier unaffected) |

OPFS `FileSystemFileHandle.createSyncAccessHandle`:

| Context | `typeof handle.createSyncAccessHandle` | Probe result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Main thread (where `probeCapabilities` runs) | `undefined` → throws `TypeError` | `'unknown'` (treated as unavailable) |
| Dedicated Worker (where `CaptureWriterWorker` runs) | `'function'` | `'supported'` |

Other genuine results on this profile: `MediaStreamTrackProcessor` ✓, `MediaStreamTrackGenerator` ✓, `RTCPeerConnection` ✓, `getDisplayMedia` ✓, VP9 encode ✓, AV1 encode ✓; `structuredClone(track,{transfer:[track]})` → `DataCloneError` (transferable MediaStreamTrack genuinely off); `RTCRtpSender.prototype.generateKeyFrame` → `undefined` (genuinely absent).

**Recording-blocker completeness.** `recordingAvailable()` (capability-probe-v2.ts:533-543) reads seven inputs. On this profile, four pass — `mediaStreamTrackProcessor:'supported'`, `displayCapture:'supported'`, `audioEncodeOpus:true`, `audioEncodeAac:true` (all probed live) — leaving exactly three failures: `videoEncodeRealtime` (B2, false negative), `opfsSyncAccessHandle` (B3, false negative), and `transferableMediaStreamTrack` (B5, genuine + too-strict gate). Therefore **B2 + B3 + B5 are the complete set of recording blockers** on the reference profile; fixing them fully restores Recording (and, via the cascade, Program Mode). The deployed build is commit `ff3b12c` (= current `main`), so every bug here reproduces on HEAD — not a stale deploy.

Live computed `.workspace.has-bin` columns were `364px 756px 360px` — matching the duplicate rule at `global.css:7649` (`364px minmax(480px,1fr) 360px`), **not** the original rule at `global.css:1691` (`232px minmax(0,1fr) 320px`), confirming the duplicate is the active rule.

## Bugs

### B1 — H.264/MP4 export silently dropped (probe codec level too low for resolution)

- **Where:** [`capability-probe-v2.ts:52-56`](../../../src/engine/capability-probe-v2.ts) (`videoCodecStrings.h264 = 'avc1.42E01E'`) used by `probeCodecs` at `width:1280,height:720` ([`:132`](../../../src/engine/capability-probe-v2.ts)); consumed by `exportConstraintsForProbe` ([`:292-306`](../../../src/engine/capability-probe-v2.ts)).
- **Observed:** `codecs.h264Encode === 'unsupported'`, so `exportConstraintsForProbe` never pushes `{codec:'h264',container:'mp4'}`. On a machine that encodes H.264 fine, the most-compatible export target is missing; only VP9/AV1 are offered.
- **Expected:** H.264/MP4 is offered whenever the platform can encode H.264 at the export resolution.
- **Root cause:** `avc1.42E01E` is H.264 **Level 3.0** (max ≈ 720×576). 1280×720 exceeds it, so `VideoEncoder.isConfigSupported` correctly returns `supported:false`. The matching **decode** probe passes only because decoders ignore the level — so the tier is unaffected and the breakage is export-only and silent.

### B2 — Recording falsely blocked: realtime-encode probe uses an invalid H.264 level for 1080p

- **Where:** [`probeVideoEncodeRealtime`, `capability-probe-v2.ts:372-388`](../../../src/engine/capability-probe-v2.ts) — `codec:'avc1.42001E'` at `1920×1080`.
- **Observed:** `capture.videoEncodeRealtime === 'unsupported'` → RecordPanel lists "Realtime video encode is unavailable." ([`RecordPanel.tsx:163-164`](../../../src/ui/RecordPanel.tsx)) and `recordingAvailable()` returns false.
- **Expected:** Realtime 1080p H.264 encode is detected on hardware that supports it (it does here).
- **Root cause:** Same level defect as B1 — Level 3.0 (`…1E`) cannot represent 1080p, so the probe is always `false` on a spec-compliant browser regardless of real capability.

### B3 — Recording falsely blocked: OPFS SyncAccessHandle probed on the wrong thread

- **Where:** [`probeOpfsSyncAccessHandle`, `capability-probe-v2.ts:406-421`](../../../src/engine/capability-probe-v2.ts), called from `probeCapabilities` ([`:580`](../../../src/engine/capability-probe-v2.ts)) which runs on the **main thread** at App startup.
- **Observed:** `handle.createSyncAccessHandle()` throws `TypeError: ... is not a function` on the main thread → probe returns `'unknown'` → RecordPanel lists "OPFS SyncAccessHandle is unavailable." ([`RecordPanel.tsx:166-167`](../../../src/ui/RecordPanel.tsx)) and `recordingAvailable()` returns false.
- **Expected:** The probe reports `'supported'` when the API works in the context where it is actually used (the capture writer worker), which it does on this machine.
- **Root cause:** `FileSystemFileHandle.createSyncAccessHandle()` is exposed only in **Worker** global scopes, never on `Window`. The probe tests the wrong context. The real consumer is [`CaptureWriterWorker`](../../../src/engine/capture/writer-worker.ts), a worker — so capture would actually work.

### B4 — "Program Mode requires a Chromium browser with WebGPU and WebCodecs" is inaccurate and cascades from B2/B3/B5

- **Where:** [`deriveProgramModeSupport`, `capability-probe-v2.ts:547-551`](../../../src/engine/capability-probe-v2.ts) (depends on `recordingAvailable()`); message at [`ProgramPanel.tsx:105`](../../../src/ui/ProgramPanel.tsx) and [`diagnostics.ts:409,412`](../../../src/engine/diagnostics.ts).
- **Observed:** Because `recordingAvailable()` is falsely false (B2 + B3) — and genuinely false via B5 — Program Mode reports unavailable with a message that blames missing "WebGPU and WebCodecs."
- **Expected:** Program Mode is available once the real capture prerequisites pass; when it is not, the message names the **actual** missing capability rather than WebGPU/WebCodecs (both present here).
- **Root cause:** The gate is a pure cascade of `recordingAvailable()`, and the user-facing copy hard-codes a WebGPU/WebCodecs explanation that does not match the true blocker.

### B5 — Recording hard-requires transferable MediaStreamTrack; publish treats the same gap as optional

- **Where:** [`recordingAvailable`, `capability-probe-v2.ts:533-543`](../../../src/engine/capability-probe-v2.ts) requires `capture.transferableMediaStreamTrack !== 'unsupported'`, while publish's [`selectTapMode`, `publish-controller.ts:40-44`](../../../src/ui/publish-controller.ts) falls back to a bounded **main-frames** mode when track transfer is missing.
- **Observed:** On this profile `transferableMediaStreamTrack === 'unsupported'` (genuine `DataCloneError`), so Recording is blocked even though `MediaStreamTrackProcessor` is supported and publish would degrade gracefully under the identical condition.
- **Expected:** Recording either uses the same bounded main-frames fallback as publish, or — if a worker-side track transfer is truly required — the gate and message say so precisely (and the `chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features` workaround is surfaced).
- **Root cause:** Recording's availability gate is stricter than the architecture requires; the publish path already proves a fallback exists for the same missing capability.

### B6 — Editor workspace overlap: duplicate `.workspace` rules override the responsive collapse

- **Where:** [`global.css:7641-7780`](../../../src/global.css) (Ark editor-kit block, PR #125) duplicates and overrides the original [`global.css:1681-1692`](../../../src/global.css) rules and the `@media (max-width:900px)` single-column collapse at [`global.css:4710-4717`](../../../src/global.css).
- **Observed:** `.workspace.has-bin` resolves to `364px minmax(480px,1fr) 360px` (live-confirmed). Below ~1236px the middle track cannot shrink past its 480px floor while the 364px dock and 360px rail stay fixed, so the grid overflows and the side docks overlap/clip the preview. The `@media (max-width:900px)` rule that should collapse to a single column never wins.
- **Expected:** One authoritative workspace rule set; columns that shrink gracefully or a breakpoint that fires before the layout's true minimum width, with no overlap at any viewport.
- **Root cause:** Two `.workspace`/`.dock-left`/`.side-rail` rule blocks now coexist. With equal specificity, the later block (line 7641) wins — and because `@media` does not raise specificity, it also defeats the narrow-screen collapse at line 4710. A dead zone of ~900–1236px results where neither the layout fits nor the breakpoint triggers.

### B7 — WebNN is detected and used but never surfaced as a capability

- **Where:** WebNN is probed in [`probeBeauty`/`preferredCleanupAcceleratorFromPlatform`, `capability-probe-v2.ts:67-81,511-519`](../../../src/engine/capability-probe-v2.ts) and used by [`dtln-ort-runtime.ts:37-41`](../../../src/engine/audio-cleanup/dtln-ort-runtime.ts) and [`beauty-runtime.ts:70-89`](../../../src/engine/beauty/beauty-runtime.ts), but is only shown indirectly as the cleanup-accelerator value ([`CapabilityMatrixPanel.tsx:278-288`](../../../src/ui/CapabilityMatrixPanel.tsx), [`AudioCleanupPanel.tsx:160-162`](../../../src/ui/AudioCleanupPanel.tsx)).
- **Observed:** The "Core WebGPU" tier label says nothing about WebNN (correctly — the tier is WebGPU-only), and there is no row that answers "is WebNN available?", so a user who enabled the WebNN flag cannot confirm it was picked up.
- **Expected:** A diagnostics/capability row reflects WebNN (`navigator.ml`) availability and the active ORT execution provider, so an enabled flag is visibly confirmed.
- **Root cause:** WebNN was wired into runtime selection but never given a user-visible capability indicator.

### B8 — Disabled "Noise Suppression" placeholder misrepresents live-chain scope

- **Where:** [`LiveAudioChainPanel.tsx:189-198`](../../../src/ui/LiveAudioChainPanel.tsx) hardcodes a disabled "Available in a future update" denoiser insert.
- **Observed:** The app already ships working noise suppression — Phase 36 **Voice Cleanup** (RNNoise WASM, the "Cleanup" tab) and Phase 27/28 **Local Audio Cleanup** (ORT DTLN, the Audio Cleanup panel). A disabled live-chain row that tells users to use another panel reads like a broken button rather than a useful control.
- **Expected:** The Live Audio Chain only shows inserts it owns. If live monitoring gets a denoiser later, wire it as a real insert; until then, do not show a disabled redirect row.
- **Root cause:** A placeholder insert label was never reconciled with the noise-suppression features shipped in later phases.

### B9 — Media Bin delete button pushed out of frame (horizontal scroll to delete)

- **Where:** [`MediaBin.tsx`](../../../src/ui/MediaBin.tsx) item = `.media-bin-item` grid (`auto minmax(0,1fr) auto` = thumbnail · meta · actions) in [`global.css`](../../../src/global.css); the actions hold the Add (`Plus`) and Remove (`Trash2`) buttons.
- **Observed:** In the narrow left dock the row's irreducible width (`.media-bin-thumb` 64px + the three 24px `.media-bin-button`s ≈ **165px**) exceeds the bin's content width. `.media-bin-list` has `overflow-y: auto`, which makes `overflow-x` compute to `auto`, so the row overflows and a **horizontal scrollbar** appears — the Remove button sits off the right edge and the user must scroll right to delete media. Measured live: the delete button leaves the frame once the bin is narrower than ~178px.
- **Aggravated by B6:** the consolidated `.workspace.has-bin` left column is 236px and the dock holds a 66px icon rail, leaving the media bin only ~162px — below the ~178px threshold — so the fix would otherwise *introduce* this overflow.
- **Expected:** The Add/Remove buttons are always in frame at every dock width; no horizontal scrolling to reach delete.
- **Root cause:** The item's fixed thumbnail + action footprint was sized for a wider bin than the consolidated dock provides, and the list permitted horizontal overflow.

# Part 2 — Editor chrome information architecture (B10–B16, Implemented)

Source: [`audits/editor-chrome-panels-2026-06-20/audit.md`](../../../audits/editor-chrome-panels-2026-06-20/audit.md) (visual + DOM-rect + code audit at 1280×720). The editor exposes the same concepts through **three competing navigation systems** with overlapping, differently-labelled entry points (left rail, top menu/toolbar, right rail). The fix is to **consolidate by user job, give every nav control one honest behavior, and never hide primary navigation behind a scrollbar**. Design lives in D10–D16; the target IA and the open product decisions are there too.

### B10 — Right-rail tabs don't fit; primary nav hidden behind a scrollbar

- **Where:** `SIDE_RAIL_TABS` ([`App.tsx:354`](../../../src/ui/App.tsx)) defines seven tabs (Inspector, Captions, Record, Program, Replay, Audio, Cleanup); `.side-rail-tab-bar` is `display:flex; overflow-x:auto` with a hidden/thin scrollbar ([`global.css:6834`](../../../src/global.css), plus duplicate blocks at ~2240, ~7854).
- **Observed (1280×720):** the rail is ~302px but the seven labels measure 62+59+50+56+48+44+55 = **374px**. Tabs overflow; `Audio`/`Cleanup` sit at/over the right edge, and activating `Cleanup` scrolls the strip left so `Inspector` (x=901) clips off the rail's left edge (971). (`cleanup-tab-attempt.json`.) Same hidden-scroll-nav anti-pattern as B9.
- **Expected:** every top-level right-rail destination is fully visible and clickable at the default viewport; switching one never clips another.

### B11 — Left rail looks like navigation but fires mixed commands

- **Where:** `.dock-rail` ([`App.tsx:4299-4334`](../../../src/ui/App.tsx)).
- **Observed:** styled as persistent workspace tabs, but: `Project`→import picker (can leave a picker-failure in the status bar), `Media`→**no handler** (dead label), `Record`/`Captions`→`openSideRailTab(...)` (switches the *right* rail), `Scopes`→floating overlay toggle, `AI`→Auto-Captions modal, `Reframe`→modal, `Output`→`scrollIntoView`.
- **Expected:** the left rail is one thing — true dock navigation **or** a clearly-styled command launcher — not both; no dead controls; no control that silently changes a different surface.

### B12 — `Cleanup` means two different things

- **Where:** top toolbar `Cleanup` ([`Toolbar.tsx:667`](../../../src/ui/Toolbar.tsx) → Local Audio Cleanup sheet) vs right-rail `Cleanup` tab (`voice-cleanup` → Voice Cleanup); a third nearby `Audio` tab is the live chain.
- **Observed:** three overlapping audio concepts (`Audio`, `Cleanup`, top-toolbar `Cleanup`) that do not lead to the same surface — not learnable.
- **Expected:** one label per concept; no bare `Cleanup` anywhere. (Completes the audio-labelling cleanup begun in B8.)

### B13 — Sparse menus duplicate the toolbar

- **Where:** [`Toolbar.tsx`](../../../src/ui/Toolbar.tsx) `MENU_GROUPS` (each appends `Search actions…` at ~251/267/283/302/311/320); `Browser capabilities` under `View` (~309) **and** the top-strip `Capabilities` chip (~726); `Help` as both menu (~316) and chip (~735).
- **Observed:** every menu repeats `Search actions…`; `Browser capabilities` and `Help` are each reachable from two redundant surfaces.
- **Expected:** menu bar = command taxonomy, toolbar = frequent actions; one home each for capability info and Help; no per-menu palette duplication.

### B14 — Right rail mixes properties, capture workflows, and audio processing

- **Where:** the seven `SIDE_RAIL_TABS`.
- **Observed:** `Inspector` (contextual properties) sits beside capture workflows (`Record`/`Program`/`Replay`) and audio processing (`Audio`/`Cleanup`) — different jobs flattened into one tab row, which also fights the left-rail `Record`/`Captions` and top `Go Live`.
- **Expected:** group by job — at most ~4 stable destinations (`Inspector`, `Text`, `Audio`, `Capture`) with secondary controls inside each.

### B15 — Beat Detection is styled but orphaned

- **Where:** `BeatPanel` under `MediaBin` in `.dock-library` ([`App.tsx:4359`](../../../src/ui/App.tsx)); transport also has `Beat` snapping.
- **Observed:** the Beat Detection card no longer looks broken but doesn't explain whether it is a media-analysis, timeline-snapping, or audio tool; its relationship to transport beat-snap is implicit.
- **Expected:** a clear home (media analysis when an audio source is selected, or an Audio/Timing panel) with an explicit link to beat-snap state.

### B16 — Unavailable states dominate the primary panel

- **Where:** `RecordPanel`/`ProgramPanel` render the full `captureUnavailableReasons(probe)` list (made accurate + exhaustive by B4/D4) in the primary body.
- **Observed:** unavailable Record/Program devote large panel space to reason lists instead of what the user can do next.
- **Expected:** a compact status row with the full browser/flag reasons behind a details disclosure/tooltip; keep a primary call-to-action.

## Non-goals

- Implementing transferable MediaStreamTrack support in the browser, or shipping a new main-thread frame-reading capture path beyond reusing publish's existing bounded main-frames fallback (B5 may land as "accurate gate + workaround surfaced" if the fallback proves out of scope).
- Adding `generateKeyFrame` support or changing WHIP GOP behavior — it is already correctly optional (publish degrades to platform-default GOP).
- The "GPU (compat)" / `limited-webcodecs` / `shell-only` tiers and their derivation (Part 1 B-bugs are encode/OPFS/layout/UX only; tier derivation is correct).
- Rebuilding the Live Audio Chain DSP; B8 removes the placeholder unless a real live-chain denoiser is implemented.
- **Part 2 (IA):** full accessibility certification (keyboard/screen-reader/responsive — the audit scopes that to a separate pass); rebuilding the underlying features (capture, voice cleanup, captions, reframe) — Part 2 is navigation/labelling/density only; changing the dark precision-instrument visual language (IA, not theme); and new left-dock panels for a full dock-switcher unless those surfaces are actually built (see D11 Option A vs B).

## Acceptance criteria

1. On a Chromium profile that can encode H.264, **H.264/MP4 appears in the export codec list** (`exportConstraintsForProbe` includes it); probing no longer fails purely due to codec **level** (B1).
2. `capture.videoEncodeRealtime` reports `'supported'` on hardware that supports realtime 1080p H.264; "Realtime video encode is unavailable" no longer shows on such hardware (B2).
3. `capture.opfsSyncAccessHandle` reflects the capability in the **worker** context where it is used; "OPFS SyncAccessHandle is unavailable" no longer shows when a worker can create a sync access handle (B3).
4. With B2 + B3 fixed, **Recording and Program Mode are available** on the reference profile (subject to B5), and the Program Mode unavailable message names the **actual** missing capability rather than WebGPU/WebCodecs (B4).
5. Recording either degrades via the same bounded main-frames fallback publish uses, or its gate/message accurately states the requirement and surfaces the experimental-flag workaround (B5).
6. There is exactly **one** authoritative `.workspace`/`.dock-left`/`.side-rail` rule set; the editor shows **no overlap** between the left dock, preview, and right side-rail across viewport widths from the collapse breakpoint up to ultra-wide, including the previously broken ~900–1236px range (B6).
7. A capability/diagnostics row reflects **WebNN** availability and the active ORT execution provider (B7).
8. The Live Audio Chain no longer shows a disabled "Noise Suppression" placeholder while the app ships Voice Cleanup / Local Audio Cleanup elsewhere (B8).
9. `pnpm run check` is green and the unit-test count does not decrease; new probe unit tests cover B1–B3 (and B5 if the fallback lands).

**Part 2 — editor chrome IA (when implemented):**

10. At 1280×720 every top-level right-rail destination is fully visible/clickable; no primary nav relies on a hidden-scrollbar `overflow-x` region, and switching one destination never clips another (B10, B14).
11. Each left-rail control's behavior matches its visual affordance; no dead controls and none silently switch a different surface (B11).
12. No bare `Cleanup` label appears on two surfaces; each audio concept maps to exactly one destination (B12).
13. No command is reachable from more than one redundant top-chrome surface (`Browser capabilities`/`Help` have one home); `Search actions…` is not repeated per menu (B13).
14. Beat Detection has a clearly-named home linked to transport beat-snap (B15); unavailable Record/Program panels show a compact status + disclosure rather than a full-body reason dump (B16).
