# Smart Reframe

Smart Reframe (Phase 33) generates an automatic crop path when you convert a
clip between aspect ratios — for example turning a 16:9 landscape clip into a
9:16 vertical one — keeping the primary subject in frame as it or the camera
moves. The full specification lives in
[`.kiro/specs/phase-33-smart-reframe/`](../.kiro/specs/phase-33-smart-reframe/design.md).

## What it produces

Smart Reframe never bakes in an opaque crop or a hard-coded rectangle. It
writes standard **transform keyframes** — `x`, `y`, and `scale` tracks — onto
the target clip, identical in every way to keyframes you author by hand. After
applying you can select the clip and edit, delete, or extend them in the
Inspector. Applying is a single undo step, and the keyframes survive project
save/load and bundle round-trips with no Smart Reframe–specific serialisation.

The aspect-ratio change itself is handled by the existing `fit: 'fill'` crop, so
the generated `scale` stays at `1.0` (extra zoom is reserved for future tighter
framing); `x`/`y` translate the layer to keep the subject centred.

## Supported aspect ratios

9:16 (vertical), 1:1 (square), 4:5 (social portrait), 16:9 (landscape), and 4:3
(classic). The source aspect ratio is derived from the clip's media dimensions
after applying rotation metadata. When the target equals the source the analysis
still runs to centre the subject, but no crop change is needed.

## The review / apply flow

1. Select a video clip, then open the command palette (**⌘K** / **Ctrl+K**) and choose **Smart Reframe**.
2. Pick a target aspect ratio.
3. **Analyse** — a dedicated, lazily-spawned worker scans the clip's used range
   at a low analysis frame rate (default 2 fps). A progress bar reports frames
   processed; **Cancel** aborts cleanly.
4. On completion, the program monitor shows a **preview overlay**: the proposed
   crop rectangle plus a dashed action-safe inner rectangle at the playhead,
   updating as you scrub. The panel reports the detection mode, frames analysed,
   shot boundaries, keyframes generated, and safe-zone compliance.
5. **Apply** writes the keyframes, **Discard** drops the result, or **Adjust**
   exposes the velocity/acceleration/analysis-rate controls for a re-analysis.

If the clip already has `x`/`y`/`scale` keyframes, Smart Reframe asks you to
confirm replacement first.

## Subject detection

- **Visual saliency** (always available, pure DSP) scores each downscaled
  analysis frame from a skin-tone mask (YCbCr), Sobel edge density, and local
  contrast, and takes the highest-scoring region as the subject centroid. This
  is the default, used until the face model is loaded.
- **Face detection** is an **optional progressive enhancement** behind the
  **Load face model** button (R0.7 click-to-load). It uses the ORT/ONNX face
  detector in `public/models/reframe-face/manifest.json`: UltraFace RFB-320
  (MIT), fetched through `/_model/gh/`, verified by SHA-256, OPFS-cached by
  digest, and run by ONNX Runtime Web in the analysis worker. The detector reads
  normalized `boxes` plus the face-class score column from `scores [N, 2]`, then
  applies TypeScript NMS before passing boxes to the tracker.

  Once the model loads, analysis tracks the highest-confidence face and falls
  back to saliency for frames with no face. If the model cannot load (offline,
  digest mismatch, ORT failure, or worker capability issue), analysis stays
  saliency-only with a "face detector unavailable; using saliency" notice. No
  image upload, no cloud inference, no telemetry.

A lightweight tracker (IoU association with one-euro smoothing) follows a single
primary subject, and shot-boundary detection (chi-squared RGB histogram
difference — pure DSP, no ML) resets tracking at hard cuts.

## Bounded motion

Pan **velocity** and **acceleration** are clamped per shot so generated motion
never whips, even on abrupt subject movement — the subject may briefly drift
from centre, the intended trade-off for watchable motion. At each cut a `hold`
keyframe is placed immediately before the boundary so the crop does not
interpolate across the edit. **Safe-zone compliance** reports the share of
frames where the subject stays inside the 90% action-safe rectangle; when it is
low, widen the bounds in **Adjust** or edit the keyframes by hand.

## Non-goals / limitations

- **One subject per clip** — no multi-subject composite framing.
- **Faces and general saliency only** — no car/pet/product object tracking.
- **No automatic cutting or reordering** — transform keyframes only.
- **Offline** — analysis scans an imported clip; there is no live-camera reframe.
