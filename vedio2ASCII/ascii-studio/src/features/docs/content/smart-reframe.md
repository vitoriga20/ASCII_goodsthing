# Smart Reframe

Smart Reframe automatically generates a crop path when you convert a clip
between aspect ratios — for example turning a 16:9 landscape clip into a 9:16
vertical one — keeping the main subject in frame as it (or the camera) moves.

Everything runs on your device. No frames, detections, or other data leave your
browser.

## What it produces

Smart Reframe never bakes in an opaque crop. It writes ordinary **transform
keyframes** (position and scale) onto the clip — the same keyframes you can
create by hand. After applying, you can select the clip and edit, delete, or
extend any of them in the Inspector. The whole reframe is a single undo step.

## Using it

1. Select a video clip on the timeline.
2. Open the command palette (**⌘K** / **Ctrl+K**) and choose **Smart Reframe**.
3. Pick a **target aspect ratio** (9:16, 1:1, 4:5, 16:9, or 4:3).
4. Click **Analyse**. A dedicated worker scans the clip; a progress bar shows
   how far it has got, and you can cancel at any time.
5. When analysis finishes, the program monitor shows a **preview overlay** of
   the proposed crop and its action-safe zone at the playhead. Scrub to check
   the motion.
6. Choose **Apply** to write the keyframes, **Discard** to throw the result
   away, or **Adjust** to change the motion bounds and re-analyse.

If the clip already has position or scale keyframes, Smart Reframe asks for
confirmation before replacing them.

## How the subject is found

- **Visual saliency** (always available) estimates the most prominent region of
  each frame from skin tone, edges, and local contrast — no machine-learning
  model required. This is the default, used until you load the face model.
- **Face detection** is an **optional progressive enhancement**, click-to-load
  the same way as Auto Captions and Audio Cleanup: open Smart Reframe and click
  **Load face model**. The shipped detector is UltraFace RFB-320 on the editor's
  ONNX Runtime foundation. It is catalog-pinned (size + SHA-256), loaded through
  a same-origin `/_model/gh/` proxy, cached locally, and run in the analysis
  worker.

  Once the detector loads, analysis tracks faces and falls back to saliency for
  frames with no face; the model stays loaded for the session. If it cannot
  load, Smart Reframe stays saliency-only.

Face detection runs **entirely on your device** — no frames or
detections are uploaded, no cloud AI is called, and no telemetry is sent.

A lightweight tracker follows one subject across the clip and smooths its path,
and **shot-boundary detection** resets the tracker at hard cuts so the crop does
not slide across an edit.

## Smooth, bounded motion

Generated motion is deliberately gentle. Pan **velocity** and **acceleration**
are capped so the crop never whips, even when the subject moves abruptly — the
subject may briefly drift from the centre, which is the intended trade-off for
watchable motion. Use **Adjust** to loosen or tighten those caps.

The panel reports **safe-zone compliance**: the share of frames where the
subject stays inside the 90% action-safe rectangle. If it is low, widen the
bounds or nudge the keyframes by hand after applying.

## Limitations

- **One subject per clip.** Smart Reframe follows a single primary subject; it
  does not compose several faces into one crop.
- **Faces and general saliency only.** It does not track specific objects such
  as cars, pets, or products.
- **No automatic cutting.** It only generates transform keyframes; it never adds
  or reorders clips.
- **Offline, not live.** Analysis scans an imported clip; there is no
  live-camera reframe.
