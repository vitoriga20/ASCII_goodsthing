# Design: Phase 20 — Editing Tools V2

> Status: **Planned** — professional NLE editing grammar on top of the gap-tolerant timeline; prerequisite for efficient multi-track workflows.

## Goal

Add the editing operations a professional NLE user expects — insert, overwrite, ripple, roll, slip, slide, lift, extract — along with linked A/V clips and track-level lock/sync/target state. Phase 10 landed gap-tolerant time-based placement, multi-select, and clipboard. Phase 20 builds real editing grammar on that foundation without altering the worker-authority or bounded-undo model.

## Model changes

### Linked groups

```
TimelineClip += { linkedGroupId?: string }
```

On import of a source with both video and audio streams, both clips receive the same `linkedGroupId` (a generated id). The link is metadata — no structural coupling in `resolveAt` or the effect chain. Link-aware operations query the timeline for all clips sharing a `linkedGroupId` and apply the positional mutation to each, or reject the entire batch if any member is blocked.

`linkClips(timeline, clipRefs[])` assigns a shared `linkedGroupId`; `unlinkClips(timeline, clipRefs[])` clears it. Both are undoable.

### Track state

```
TimelineTrack += {
  locked: boolean,
  visible: boolean,
  syncLocked: boolean,
  editTarget: boolean,
}
```

Defaults: `locked: false`, `visible: true`, `syncLocked: false`, `editTarget: true`. Persisted in the project document via the Phase 9 serializer; `schemaVersion` bump with additive defaults so existing documents upgrade cleanly.

- **Locked** — the track-lock guard is a precondition check at the top of every mutating pure function in `timeline.ts`. If the target track is locked, the function returns the original timeline reference (no-op), which `commitTimelineMutation` detects as unchanged and skips history push.
- **Visible** — consumed by `resolveAllAt` and `compositeLayers` in the pipeline worker to skip hidden tracks during preview and export compositing. Hidden tracks are still editable.
- **Sync locked** — consumed only by ripple-class operations (ripple delete, ripple trim, insert, extract). When a ripple shifts clips on track A by delta, every sync-locked track shifts all clips whose start is at or after the ripple point by the same delta. If a sync-locked clip *spans* the ripple point (starts before, ends after), the entire operation is rejected rather than silently desyncing. If a sync-locked track is also locked, the entire ripple is rejected. For extract, any clip overlap (not just spanning) on a non-targeted sync-locked track rejects the operation.
- **Edit target** — consumed only by insert and overwrite. Non-targeted tracks are skipped; if the only matching target track is locked, the operation is rejected.

### New pure functions in `timeline.ts`

| Function | Semantics |
|----------|-----------|
| `insertEdit(timeline, targetTrackIds, clips, atTime, syncLockedTrackIds)` | Place clips at `atTime` on target tracks; shift downstream clips on those tracks right by inserted duration; shift clips on sync-locked tracks by the same delta. |
| `overwriteEdit(timeline, targetTrackIds, clips, atTime)` | Place clips at `atTime` on target tracks; split-trim or delete any clips in the overwritten range; no downstream shift. |
| `rippleDelete(timeline, clipRefs, syncLockedTrackIds)` | Remove clips; shift downstream clips left by total removed duration per track; shift sync-locked tracks. |
| `rippleTrim(timeline, trackId, clipId, edge, time, syncLockedTrackIds, sourceDuration?)` | Trim clip edge; shift downstream clips by the trim delta; shift sync-locked tracks. |
| `rollTrim(timeline, trackId, clipId, edge, time, sourceDurations)` | Move the cut point between adjacent clips; extend one, shorten the other; clamp by source bounds on both sides. |
| `slipEdit(timeline, trackId, clipId, deltaS, sourceDuration)` | Shift `inPoint` by delta without changing `start` or `duration`; clamp to `[0, sourceDuration - duration]`. |
| `slideEdit(timeline, trackId, clipId, deltaS, sourceDurations)` | Shift clip position by delta; adjust predecessor's out-point and successor's in-point; clamp by all three source bounds. |
| `liftRegion(timeline, targetTrackIds, startTime, endTime)` | Remove the region from target tracks, leaving gaps; trim clips at boundaries. |
| `extractRegion(timeline, targetTrackIds, startTime, endTime, syncLockedTrackIds)` | Remove the region and shift downstream clips left; shift sync-locked tracks. |
| `linkClips(timeline, clipRefs)` | Assign a shared `linkedGroupId`. |
| `unlinkClips(timeline, clipRefs)` | Clear `linkedGroupId` on the specified clips. |
| `setTrackLock(timeline, trackId, locked)` | Toggle lock state. |
| `setTrackVisible(timeline, trackId, visible)` | Toggle visibility. |
| `setTrackSyncLock(timeline, trackId, syncLocked)` | Toggle sync lock. |
| `setTrackEditTarget(timeline, trackId, editTarget)` | Toggle edit target. |

Every function returns the original timeline reference on no-op (locked-track rejection, nothing to do), which the worker detects as unchanged and skips history.

### Linked-clip dispatch

A helper `expandLinkedGroup(timeline, clipRefs)` returns the full set of clips including all linked partners. Edit operations call this before executing:

- **Positional operations** (move, delete, ripple delete, duplicate, insert, overwrite, extract, slide): expand to linked group, check all target tracks are unlocked, apply to all or reject entirely.
- **Split**: expands to linked group — all linked partners are split at the same timeline time. `linkedGroupId` is cleared on all halves (pragmatic unlink-on-split to avoid ambiguous group membership across fragments).
- **Slip**: expands to linked group — all members slip by the same delta to maintain A/V sync.
- **Roll trim**: applied to adjacent pair only; if either clip has linked partners on other tracks, those partners are not rolled (roll is a same-track boundary operation).
- **Unlink**: only then can members be edited independently. Orphaned sole members (groups with < 2 remaining members) have their `linkedGroupId` cleared automatically.

If expanding the linked group finds a member on a locked track, the operation returns the original timeline (no-op).

## Protocol

New commands added to `WorkerCommand`:

```
'insert-edit'     { targetTrackIds, clips: ClipboardTimelineClip[], atTime }
'overwrite-edit'  { targetTrackIds, clips: ClipboardTimelineClip[], atTime }
'ripple-delete'   { clips: ClipReference[] }
'ripple-trim'     { trackId, clipId, edge, time }
'roll-trim'       { trackId, clipId, edge, time }
'slip-edit'       { trackId, clipId, deltaS }
'slide-edit'      { trackId, clipId, deltaS }
'lift-region'     { targetTrackIds, startTime, endTime }
'extract-region'  { targetTrackIds, startTime, endTime }
'link-clips'      { clips: ClipReference[] }
'unlink-clips'    { clips: ClipReference[] }
'set-track-lock'  { trackId, locked }
'set-track-visible'  { trackId, visible }
'set-track-sync-lock'  { trackId, syncLocked }
'set-track-edit-target'  { trackId, editTarget }
```

`timeline-state` already carries the full track list; the new track fields serialize into existing `TimelineTrackSnapshot`. No new state message types needed.

The worker handler for each edit command:
1. Derives `syncLockedTrackIds` and `targetTrackIds` from current track state.
2. Expands linked groups via `expandLinkedGroup`.
3. Calls the pure function.
4. Commits via `commitTimelineMutation` (which handles history, transition reconciliation, and state broadcast).

## UI gesture model

Gestures live in `src/ui/` and are decoupled from worker mutations. The UI owns transient drag-preview state; the worker owns committed state.

### Gesture lifecycle

```
pointerdown  → capture tool mode + initial snapshot from mirror
pointermove  → update local SolidJS preview signal (no worker command)
pointerup    → compute final delta from snapshot → send ONE worker command
```

This avoids posting full timeline snapshots on every pointermove. The UI shows a CSS-transformed preview overlay during the drag; the committed timeline state arrives via the normal `timeline-state` message after the worker processes the command.

### Tool modes

The active tool determines how a drag on a clip or clip edge is interpreted:

| Tool | Click / drag on clip body | Drag on left edge | Drag on right edge |
|------|---------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Select (V) | Move (existing) | Trim (existing) | Trim (existing) |
| Ripple (B) | Ripple move* | Ripple trim | Ripple trim |
| Roll (N) | — | Roll trim | Roll trim |
| Slip (Y) | Slip edit | — | — |
| Slide (U) | Slide edit | — | — |

*Ripple move = move + ripple-close the vacated gap. Implemented as ripple-delete at old position + insert at new position, coalesced as one history entry. If the insertion point is downstream of the deleted clip, the target time must be adjusted by the delete's ripple delta (since deletion shifts all downstream timecodes left).

Tool mode is a UI-only signal; the worker commands are tool-agnostic.

### Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| V | Select tool |
| B | Ripple tool |
| N | Roll tool |
| Y | Slip tool |
| U | Slide tool |
| , (comma) | Insert edit from source/bin selection |
| . (period) | Overwrite edit from source/bin selection |
| Shift+Delete / Shift+Backspace | Ripple delete selection |
| Delete / Backspace | Lift (existing delete becomes lift) |
| ' (apostrophe) | Extract selection |
| Cmd/Ctrl+L | Toggle track lock on focused track |

All shortcuts route through the existing `src/ui/keyboard.ts` focus-aware handler. Tool-mode shortcuts are blocked when focus is in a text input or the Inspector.

## Conflict behavior

### Gaps

- Insert and ripple operations create or close gaps as defined.
- Overwrite and lift may create gaps (by design).
- Roll, slip, and slide never create gaps.

### Locked tracks

A locked track is an absolute barrier. If any clip in the operation set (including linked partners) lives on a locked track, the entire operation returns no-op. The UI should indicate the rejection (flash the lock icon, not a modal).

### Transitions

All operations call the existing `reconcileTransitions` path after mutation. Transitions are boundary objects between adjacent clips — any operation that breaks adjacency or exhausts source headroom drops the transition. This is explicit and consistent with Phase 13.

### Markers

- Ripple operations (ripple delete, ripple trim, insert, extract) shift markers that are at or after the ripple point by the same delta.
- Ripple delete and extract first remove markers inside the deleted/extracted range (exclusive end: markers at the range boundary are preserved), then shift remaining markers.
- For linked A/V ripple deletes, overlapping removal regions are merged before marker shifting to prevent double-shifting.
- Non-ripple operations (overwrite, lift, roll, slip, slide) leave markers in place.
- Marker shift is part of the same atomic mutation and undo entry; if the underlying operation is rejected (returns original timeline), markers are not shifted.

Helpers: `shiftMarkers(markers, afterTime, deltaS)`, `removeMarkersInRange(markers, startTime, endTime)` (exclusive end).

### Offline media

Clips with unresolved sources participate in all positional operations (move, delete, ripple, insert, overwrite, lift, extract). They block slip, roll, and slide operations that require `sourceDuration` for clamping — returning no-op rather than corrupting bounds. Slide edits extend adjacent clips, which requires knowing their source duration; if any adjacent clip has an unresolved source, the slide is rejected.

### Ripple trim semantics

- **Out-edge**: shift downstream clips by the change in duration (shrink → shift left; extend → shift right).
- **In-edge inward** (shrink, trimming head right): close the gap by shifting the trimmed clip and all downstream clips left. This reduces the timeline duration.
- **In-edge outward** (extend, trimming head left): the out-edge stays put, so no downstream shift is needed. This is equivalent to a non-ripple trim for the extension direction.

### Keyframe rebasing

When overwrite or lift splits a clip into left/right fragments, keyframes are rebased:
- Left fragment: keyframes are normalized to the shorter duration (tracks beyond the new duration are removed).
- Right fragment: keyframes are rebased via `rebaseTrimmedKeyframes` so that local time 0 corresponds to the fragment's new start in the source.

### Duplicate/paste link isolation

`cloneWithNewId` (used by duplicate and paste) clears `linkedGroupId` on the clone. This prevents duplicated clips from remaining in the original's link group, which would cause subsequent linked operations to affect both originals and copies.

## Modules

| Module | Work |
|--------|------|
| `src/engine/timeline.ts` | New pure functions: `insertEdit`, `overwriteEdit`, `rippleDelete`, `rippleTrim`, `rollTrim`, `slipEdit`, `slideEdit`, `liftRegion`, `extractRegion`, `linkClips`, `unlinkClips`, `setTrackLock`, `setTrackVisible`, `setTrackSyncLock`, `setTrackEditTarget`, `expandLinkedGroup`, `shiftMarkers`. |
| `src/engine/worker.ts` | Command handlers for all new commands; derive sync/target state before calling pure functions; commit via existing `commitTimelineMutation`. |
| `src/protocol.ts` | New command types; extend `TimelineTrackSnapshot` with `locked`, `visible`, `syncLocked`, `editTarget`; extend `TimelineClipSnapshot` with `linkedGroupId`. |
| `src/engine/project.ts` | `schemaVersion` bump; additive defaults for new track/clip fields on deserialization. |
| `src/ui/timeline-interaction.ts` | Tool-mode signal; gesture lifecycle (pointerdown/move/up → preview → commit); `expandLinkedGroup` mirror for preview highlighting. |
| `src/ui/TimelineClip.tsx` | Linked-clip indicator; slip/slide/roll preview overlays. |
| `src/ui/Timeline.tsx` | Track header controls: lock, visibility, sync lock, edit target toggles. |
| `src/ui/keyboard.ts` | Tool-mode shortcuts (V/B/N/Y/U), insert/overwrite (,/.), ripple delete (Shift+Del), extract ('). |

## Validation

- Unit tests cover every operation × {single-track, multi-track, gap, locked, sync-locked, linked A/V, transition-adjacent, marker, offline clip}.
- Locked-track rejection produces no history entry and no state broadcast.
- Drag gestures coalesce to one undo entry (unit-test the coalesce key).
- Linked-clip operations are all-or-nothing (no partial application).
- Manual: import A/V source → split → ripple delete → insert at playhead → roll trim the cut → slip a clip → slide a clip → lock a track → verify lock blocks edits → undo entire sequence step by step → export.
- `npm run build` and `npm test` green; test count grows.
