/**
 * Curated catalog of on-device ASR models and the allowlist of hosts the loader
 * is permitted to fetch them from (Phase 29).
 *
 * Two intents:
 *
 * 1. **Trust.** Model assets are large binaries that run as code through ORT.
 *    They may be fetched only from this app's own origin or a small allowlist of
 *    reputable, CORS-friendly model hosts — never an
 *    arbitrary URL a manifest happens to name. The digest check still pins exact
 *    bytes; the allowlist additionally pins *where* they may come from.
 *
 * 2. **Choice.** Each catalog entry carries a human description, provider, and a
 *    `infoUrl` model-card link the UI surfaces so users can read about a model
 *    before downloading it. The list is structured to hold many models; today it
 *    ships two (Whisper Base + Tiny) and the UI shows a picker once there is more
 *    than one. Both can be downloaded and kept at once (OPFS keys assets by
 *    SHA-256), so switching between them never re-downloads.
